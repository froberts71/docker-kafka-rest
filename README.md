# Kafka REST Proxy

The Kafka REST Proxy provides a RESTful interface to a Kafka cluster. It makes it easy to produce and consume messages, view the state of the cluster, and perform administrative actions without using the native Kafka protocol or clients. It is a part of the [Confluent Platform](https://confluent.io/product/).
